# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of basic machine learning algorithms written by directly translating mathematical definitions into code.
The purpose is to record and verify understanding, not to optimize performance, provide abstractions, or compete with existing libraries.

## Included
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Linear Regression (closed form, gradient descent, ridge)
- Logistic Regression (binary, multiclass)
- SVM (Dual hard and soft forms, primal)
- Perceptron (Functional and geomtric margins)

More algorithms will be added incrementally as they are implemented and understood.
