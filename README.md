# Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of basic machine learning algorithms written by directly translating mathematical definitions into code.
The purpose is to record and verify understanding, not to optimize performance, provide abstractions, or compete with existing libraries.

## Included

### Supervised Learning
- Gaussian Naive Bayes  
- Linear Regression (closed form, gradient descent, ridge)  
- Logistic Regression (binary, multiclass)  
- Perceptron (functional and geometric margins)  
- Support Vector Machines  
  - Primal (hard and soft margin)  
  - Dual (hard and soft margin)  
  - Kernelized SVM  
  - SMO solver  
- AdaBoost  
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

### Unsupervised Learning
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

More algorithms will be added incrementally as they are implemented and understood.
## Notes
- All algorithms are implemented for understanding, not efficiency.
- Code is intentionally explicit and avoids heavy abstractions.
